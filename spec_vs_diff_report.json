ContactSection.tsx displays the address split across 'value' and 'sub' fields ('Saharanpur Rd, Gangoh Khalsa' and 'Uttar Pradesh 247341'), and the frontend-file-summaries.txt confirms Footer.tsx also displays the full address. No placeholder text remains, and no hallucinated features were detected.",
